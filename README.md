# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ju Sang Han.

## My Goal
Data Analyst / Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer

## Motivation 
I first learned about AI through a matchup between AlphaGo and Go player Sedol Lee. Through this, I learned that AI can benefit people. During my classes at Kyung Hee University, I was impressed by the subject called machine learning. Machine learning literally means that machines learn by recognizing human behavior and patterns. This is a subject that made me realize that AI has an algorithm that thinks logically. With this opportunity, I want to research algorithms that are better than those used previously by squeezing data such as images and videos that contain people's patterns into algorithms, and I want to collaborate with many people rather than alone.
